# Django-Project
This is my First Django Project in which I made a Responsive Website on Nature Blog using Django Python Framework. 
In this Django App, first I used Django Default Server for the Development Purpose and then for Delpoyment Purpose, I used Heroku to deploy it.
I used basic Html, CSS Style Sheets and some of the Bootstrap Classes for the Front-End of this Django Project.
For Back-End, I used the Default Database Connectivity of Django Python Framework.
Also, I provide basic Signup, Login and Logout User Authentication System on this website using Django Python Framework to make my project more user-friendly.
